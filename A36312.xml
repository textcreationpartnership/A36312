            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT Infinitely Wiſe God, who does what he will, and <hi>gives not account of any of his Matters,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job.</hi> 33. 13.</note> has made a breach upon us. That God who gave at firſt, and for many years continued, has now removed from us a dear and tender Mother. This Arrow that killed one, wounded all; that Stroke that took away Life from her, took away an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Wife from our honoured Father, and a dear Mother from you and me. At once
<pb facs="tcp:60842:3"/> (fatal hour!) ſhe was left a breathleſs Corps; he a ſolitary Widdower; and we Motherleſs Children. What a ſad and ſudden change is made in Perſons, and Families, when Death knocks at the door and enters in! The <hi>Root now</hi> is dead, and dry; tho' the many <hi>Branches</hi> are yet ſpar'd. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, God continued us an entire Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: <hi>The Deſtroying Angel</hi> that knockt at many doors, viſited many houſes, paſs'd by <hi>ours:</hi> When the Ax has been laid at the Root of many Families, when many Branches have been lopt off, and many Trees hewn and cut down; we ſtood in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard untoucht: But Death will come, and a parting time will come. Will come! alas! it is come. The ſweetneſs of her Temper, the greatneſs of her Love, the tenderneſs of her Affection, the Grace of God in her; whatever might endear a Mother, rendered her company delightful, and her preſence a great part of our earthly happineſs: But God would have her home, and would not that the Manſion deſigned for her ſhould ſtand any longer empty. That Body which had many Infirmities, and which a-while-a-go with grief and tears we beheld pined and waſted; conſum'd and worn with lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing ſickneſs, is now at reſt: And the
<pb facs="tcp:60842:3"/> more noble Soul is <hi>now</hi> among the <hi>Spirits of Juſt men made perfect:</hi> Thus hath <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23.</note> her heavenly Father diſpoſed of her; and is it not time to think what is our work and duty? is it to weep and mourn? While ſhe lived ſhe was worthy to be loved; and now ſhe is dead ſhe is worthy to be lamented; and ſilent Tears will, and may ſpeak what words muſt not. Hath Death remov'd, and the Grave buried her out of our ſight? did ſhe take leave of us with her cold, and dying Lips; and is ſhe gone, and muſt we ſee her no more? Sad thought! may we not weep and mourn? we may, we ought; but yet there is ſomething of greater importance that ſuch Providences call for, and ſhould be the employment of ſurviving Relations.</p>
            <p>The Red has been ſpeaking, and yet ſpeaks; Lord! grant we may hear the Voice, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Language, know the meaning, and obey the Call of it. Death hath been ſpeaking, the Grave with open mouth hath been ſpeaking, her laſt Sickneſs, Deceaſe, and Funeral have been ſpeaking: O that I, and you may have an Ear to hear what this Providence ſaith! While ſhe was with us ſhe ſpent that <hi>little</hi> time, and the <hi>leſs</hi> breath ſhe had in ſpeaking for God's Glory, and the good of others. Oh! never forget
<pb facs="tcp:60842:4"/> that Affectionate Exclamation, <hi>Oh love the Lord, all ye my Children!</hi> And <hi>being dead ſhe yet ſpeaketh;</hi> and with <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4.</note> a louder Voice too. She had <hi>no greater Joy than to ſee her Children walking in the Truth.</hi> No doubt you are Children of many Prayers and Tears; ſhe travailed with you again, and long'd to ſee Chriſt formed in you; and I doubt not but it was a comfort to ſee ſuch probable grounds to hope you were born again: That you were not only <hi>born of her, but born of Water and the Holy Spirit;</hi> and I will venture to ſay ſhe loved none ſo much for bearing <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John.</hi> 3. 5.</note> her <hi>Likeneſs,</hi> as for having the <hi>Image</hi> of God. Her higheſt ambition was to ſee you good, holy, and living in the Fear of God; and when you were to change your condition, and enter into a Married ſtate, her earneſt deſire was, you might <hi>Marry in the Lord,</hi> and be diſpoſed of to ſuch as might further, not hinder you in the way <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 39.</note> to Heaven; it did delight her, to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in her laſt Sickneſs, that <hi>ſome</hi> of you have ſuch.</p>
            <p>Her early Inſtructions, ſerious Counſels, ſeaſonable Reproofs, holy Example, fervent Prayers, and many Tears ſpoke Love to your precious and Immortal Souls: What but
<pb facs="tcp:60842:4"/> this was the Language of all? <hi>Lord! ſave me, and mine too; let me go to Heaven, and let my dear Children fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after: Be thou a God, Friend, and Father to me and them; bind up my</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Soul, and the Souls of mine in the bundle of Life.</hi> And now bleſſed be God all of this kind has not been in vain. She lived to ſee the fruit of her labour, and her Prayers in part anſwered; and what is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, I hope, and I pray God it may be but the firſt-fruits, earneſt, and pledge of what is yet behind. Have you begun well, and are you ſet out in your Journey to Heaven? Go on, and hold out. Has the Spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, renewed, and changed you? Have you the Likeneſs of God, and the Image of Chriſt? Have you given up your ſelves in a ſerious and ſolemn manner to the Bleſſed Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit? Is ſin your grief and burden; the object of your ſorrow and hatred? do you oppoſe, reſiſt, and fight againſt it? perſevere to the end, and the Crown is yours. Let nothing diſcourage you; if the way be rugged, and your Journey tedious; if you are threatned with Storms and Tempeſts; if you find it hard to watch, and pray, to wreſtle, and conflict, to deny your ſelves, live by Faith, and perform many duties, which are contrary to corrupt Nature, don't faint, tire, and give
<pb facs="tcp:60842:5"/> out; Heaven is at the end of your Journey, and Heaven (oh believe and think oft on it!) will make amends for all: When once you are there, with an over-flowing Joy will you think of theſe Afflictions, Croſſes, and Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments; for then you ſhall ſee, know, and be fully convinc'd that Infinite Wiſdom made them all ſerviceable to your Eternal Welfare. Tho' the fleſh is pain'd and ſmarts, yet a time will come, when you ſhall praiſe your heavenly Father for ſeaſonable Chaſtiſements, and the Diſcipline of his Rod. Tho' the fleſh may be uneaſie, and the burden may pinch you; tho' the Rod may make you groan, and weep; tho' Satan may tempt, and your own hearts may be ready to queſtion your Relation to, and Covenant-Intereſt in God; his Love to you, or yours to him, becauſe it is ſo, and ſo with you; yet don't ſay, nay, don't ſo much as think there are any more bitter Ingredients in your Cup than are neceſſary; than both the Wiſdom, and Bowels of a Father adviſe.</p>
            <p>Is Satan buſie to fill you with doubts and fears; needleſs ſuſpicions, and groundleſs jealouſies? does he draw a Curtain before, or caſt a Veil upon your faces? does he labour to magnifie your Sins, blot your Evidences, and extinguiſh your Hope; and are you caſt down, and go mourning all the day long becauſe of
<pb facs="tcp:60842:5"/> this? why ſhould you? is it not an Argument Satan has loſt his game, and you are none of his Slaves, becauſe he thus diſquiets you? Do you mourn after God, and pant, and breathe for him? is it nothing but the light of his Countenance, the ſmiles of his Face, and a ſenſe of his Love can content you? Are you looking to ſee the Image of God upon your hearts; and is it your grief, and trouble you cannot ſee it ſo plain, and legible as you ſhould, and would, and deſire? and hereupon do you conclude you have no Grace? What! when even theſe tears and groans tell you you have. Tho' you may <hi>walk in darkneſs,</hi> as many <hi>Children of Light</hi> have, and do; yet ſtay your ſelves on God, and wait for him. Oh how eaſily, and quickly can the breath of God ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all theſe Clouds which darken your Souls, and the Light of his Countenance make a bright and a joyful day!</p>
            <p>Having this opportunity to teſtifie my Love to you, eſpecially to your Souls; I ſhall beg, and preſume on my Readers patience, while upon this occaſion I give you ſome counſels, which I pray God may be uſeful to you, and many more in the like circumſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Bleſs God it was your Lot and Happineſs, to be born of ſuch holy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; whereof one is taken, and the</hi>

I am far from ſaying, that Grace runs in a Blood, that Children are Heirs to the <hi>Graces,</hi> as they are to the <hi>Riches</hi> of their Parents; but yet it is a Priviledge to be born of ſuch. I do, and I would have you heartily bleſs God for it! How ſad a thought is it! I am born of them who are Enemies to God, Slaves to theſe Luſts, and Servants to the Devil. What a ſad <hi>Example</hi> do ſuch ſet before their poor Children in caſe they live; and what a dreadful Legacy, how many Woes, and Curſes do they bequeath to 'em in caſe they die before 'em!

            <pb facs="tcp:60842:6"/>
            <p> But how comfortable is it to ſit down and think! God a long time before my Birth, order'd I ſhould be born of ſuch, and ſuch, who were his familiar Friends, and dear Servants. I have a Father, a Mother in whom I can ſee the Image of God; who are united to Chriſt; and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the Holy Spirit. Is it not a mercy to be the Children of ſuch? Are not they more likely in a ſerious, conſcientious, and ſober manner to devote, and dedicate their new-born Infants in Baptiſm to God? when others only complement with God, and bring them to the <hi>Laver of Regeneration</hi> out of Cuſtom, Ceremony, and for Faſhion ſake; they will do it with a deep ſenſe of God's Goodneſs and Mercy: And great may be the benefit of this ſolemn Tranſaction, and early Dedication. Will not ſuch Parents when they look upon their own act and deed, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what they promiſed in the Name and ſtead of their Children, be put upon performing conſequent Duties; as earneſt and ſervent Prayer to God for them, a timely inſtructing them in the Chriſtian Religion, ſetting before 'em an holy Example, and watching over their firſt, early, and ungovern'd years? and how beneficial may all this be! are not ſuch Children like to have the benefit of an holy,

Theſe are (does the great God as it were ſay) the Children of my Covenant-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; they were born in my Family, enter'd into my Service, and I will be their God as I was the God of their Father, and Mother; their Holy Parents devoted them to me, and I accepted, ſet my mark upon them; they are mine, and they ſhall be mine, and know what it is to be born of thoſe who were my Friends and Favourites.

            <p>Truly the Children of ſuch Parents owe more thanks to God, upon this account than uſually they are aware of. How few on their Knees, heartily acknowledge God's Goodneſs, and mercy to 'em in this reſpect! while others pride themſelves, in the greatneſs of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, the nobleneſs of their deſcent, and that they have more pure and refined blood running in their Veins than others; Bleſs the Lord, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> that I had a Father who was a Son; and a Mother who was a Daughter of God. This Children ſhould do, not only
<pb facs="tcp:60842:7"/> while Parents are alive; but when dead: a deep ſenſe, and a thankful acknowledgement of God's goodneſs ſhould ſurvive their Funeral; render their memory very very pretious, and force lively praiſes from us, when they are faln aſleep. Let me add, that this duty is moſt reaſonable, and the neglect of it moſt cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable if God hath bleſſed all, or any of their endeavours to our Converſion. Were they under God, the means of our <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> birth? the inſtruments of conveying Natural, and Spiritual Life? Is it owing to them that we are <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>Women;</hi> and to their Prayers and Tears; inſtructions and counſels that we are <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> Did God bleſs our Education, and was it the means of an early and laſting Piety? Our Debt is increas'd, and a double Tribute of Praiſe is owing to God.</p>

               <hi>IV. Exerciſe a ſerious, ſolemn, and hearty Repentance for all ſin.</hi> When I conſider our dear, and excellent Mother was not taken away by a ſudden, and ſurprizing stroke; but a long, and pining ſickneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the way: that ſhe was not taken off in the midſt of her days; but lent to us for a conſiderable number of years: that ſhe lived, till ſhe ſaw many of her Children's Children, and did not fall aſleep, nor go to Bed till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Evening; I would hope, there was no particular ſin of ours provoked God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb facs="tcp:60842:10"/> her at this time. But alas! we all have many ſins, and ſhould not ſuch a Providence awaken our Repentance? It ſhould; it tends that way; and I pray God it may. Let us ſearch our ways, examine our hearts, conſider what ſin, or ſins have been too much allowed, and winked at. Sin is the cauſe of Death to our ſelves, and to thoſe whom we dearly love: <hi>theſe, theſe</hi> are the murderers of our friends, and relations; let us ſend an <hi>hue and cry</hi> after them; and when we have found them out, let us Crucifie them. Oh, that no ſin, tho' never ſo dear, pleaſant, or ſecret may ſurvive this funeral! our departed Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have no need of our groans and tears: oh! let us labour to conſecrate our ſorrow, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the flowing ſtreams into the Channel of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that that, which was natural, may commence Divine.</p>
            <p>How proper is the Death of Relations to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, and quicken Repentance! how much may the remembrance of their ſick-bed Diſcourſes; their dying ſpeeches; their farewel counſels; and the great change one moment made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, to ſoften, break, and humble our hearts! to make us ſerious, and ſolevin in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing our Repentance! at ſuch a time, how eaſily is the paſſion of ſorrow moved! do you weep for her? methinks I hear her (having
<pb facs="tcp:60842:11"/> no need of pity and tears! ſaying, <hi>weep not <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 28.</note> for me.</hi> Do you weep for ſin? pretious tears! comfortable ſorrow! oh! weep on; and weep more. Every Corps, Funeral, and Grave tells us what an evil ſin is; and ſhould provoke us to Repent: but when Death comes into the very Houſe where we live, takes away one of our own number, ſtrikes, and kills a dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; when it is a Father, a Mother, a Husband, a Wife, a Child that is carried <hi>to the Houſe appointed for all the living;</hi>

                  <hi>Job</hi> 30. 23.</note> the call to Repentance is more ſolemn, loud, plain, and particular; and ought to be more awakening.</p>
            <p>After the Death and Funeral of ſuch, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is a very ſeaſonable duty. Now is the proper time, to offer to God <hi>the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>

Can I behold their pale, wan, and ghaſtly Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; the Soul being gone? Can I ſee them wrapped up in a Shrowd, and nailed up in a Coſſin? Can I attend their Funeral, look into the dark, and deep Grave where I muſt leave a—to Worms and Rottenneſs and not think hardly of ſin; and not reſolve by the Grace of God to kill, and mortifie it? at ſuch

               <hi>V. Be very careful to keep God among you.</hi> Do, what in you lieth that God may be the God of your Poſterity after you: that they under you may lay claim to the Covenant, and the Bleſſings of it. Endeavour that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the Life, and Power of it may flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, not only in your own Hearts; but in your families. Let not FAMILY PRAYER be thruſt out; nor adjourned to thoſe hours in which you are leaſt of all fit for this awful, and important duty. May we all ſtrive to keep up the friendſhip begun between God and our Family! Since God hath made all of you (except one) Mothers: reckon it is your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to bring up your Children for God: teach them to know your God, and your Fathers God, and that God, to whom in Baptiſm you have devoted them; that when you ſhall be dead, cold, and rotting in the Grave; they may be ſerving and honouring God in your place and ſtead. That Religion, and the fear of God may not die out of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
<pb facs="tcp:60842:12"/> when you ſhall. 'Tis true you cannot give them Grace; but you can inſtruct, teach counſel, adviſe, exhort, and perſuade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you can ſet a good example, you can pray to God for them, and plead that Covenant, you entered them into almoſt as ſoon as God gave them to you: and all this you ought; and I hope you will be careful to do.</p>
            <p>Tho' the preſence, awe, and fear of living Parents may reſtrain Children from ſome ſins and vices; tho' their examples, and counſels may influence them ſo far, as to perſuade them to take up <hi>a form of Godlineſs;</hi> yet (oh, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5.</note> what Tears are ſufficient to bewail this fatal degeneracy!) what a dead, ſpiritleſs, and lifeleſs thing is the Religion of many ſuch, as ſoon as their godly Parents are Dead, and cold in their Graves! how oft doth that ground that was manured, and cultivated, plow'd and ſown; ay, and watered with many ſhowers of Tears, bring forth a ſad crop of Briars and Thorns! Some Children are a grief and heart breaking to their Parents while they live; and many more, are a reproach, and diſgrace to them when dead and gone: how many Children of ſuch Parents, notwithſtanding the benefit of a good education, ſeaſonable inſtructions, wiſe reproofs, and timely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, live at that rate, that they are a blot
<pb facs="tcp:60842:12"/> to their family, and a diſgrace to their name! If any ſuch ſhall chance to read theſe lines I charge them in the name of God, to conſider what a ſad caſe they are in; and I pray God to convince them of their ſin and folly; and how near they are to a ſudden, and final ruin. Would to God, ſuch would conſider how greatly they will be aſhamed; and how little they will have to ſay for themſelves when the Prayers and Tears of their <hi>Living;</hi> and the Duſt of their <hi>Dead</hi> Parents ſhall riſe up in Judgment againſt, and condemn them. <hi>But I hope better</hi>

How do the near approaches of it caſt us into cold clammy ſweats and mortal tremblings! How doth every day (when we give our ſelves the liberty of thinking,) partake of the horror of our laſt!

Muſt we ſee their faces, enjoy their company, and converſe with them no more? no more! ſad thought! no more! killing word! O Death! Death! what a cruel Enemy art thou to Mankind!</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Open, and explain the Character of the perſon here ſpoken of; and who is to be the Subject of our preſent diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider what is here ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and taken for granted with reference to this Righteous man; and that is, he muſt die.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60842:16"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider and amplifie the priviledge of ſuch an one; as having hope in his death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Make ſome practical improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole; in applying all to our ſelves; who are yet alive, but muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, and quickly, die.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, I ſhall conſider, and explain the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Perſon, who is intended in theſe words, and who hath ſome priviledge beyond the reſt of mankind.</hi> Here, is mention made of a very great benefit: and that none might think, it promiſcuouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all, the Holy-Ghoſt gives us the character of the Perſon concerned in it, [the Righteous] for opening and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the character I have not time, neither is it neceſſary to give an account of the ſeveral acceptations of the word, it is ſufficient to take notice that this word [Righteouſneſs] which peculiarly qualifies, and diſtinguiſhes the ſubject of our diſcourſe, is frequently uſed in a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſenſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt; In a more limited and reſtrained ſenſe: and ſo it is no more than a particular Vertue, which inclineth and diſpoſeth a man to give to every one his right.</hi> When a man doth not by any little tricks, or cunning artifices, which the Wits of our Age call myſteries of Trade; go beyond, defraud,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60842:16"/> over-reach, or wrong another he is Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: this is a conſiderable branch of morality, a duty belonging to the Law of Nature, and hath its proper place among the duties of the ſecond Table. Were this Virtue more common we might deal with our fellow Creatures, with more openneſs and freedom, with more plainneſs and leſs fear: we might truſt another without ſurmiſe, ſuſpicion, and jealouſie. This vertue is famous and renowned, and that juſtly too, among Heathens; and would God there were more of it in the Chriſtian World! Were all men juſt and upright, honeſt, ſincere, and plain hearted in their commerce; as unwilling to impoſe upon, and wrong another, as they are loth to be deceiv'd and cheated themſelves; did they manage their affairs without that <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cunning Sophiſtry which is from <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jam. 3. 15.</note> and therefore is not only <hi>earthly</hi> and <hi>ſenſual;</hi> but <hi>Helliſh</hi> and <hi>Deviliſh</hi> too, what a bleſſed World, and what an happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation ſhould we ſee! But tho' this be good and laudable, and more of it is to be wiſht for; yet it is but a particular Vertue, and tho' it adorn the man, it will not make, nor denominate him a Chriſtian. It is only like the painting and garniſhing of a Sepulchre, that makes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60842:17"/> it indeed more ſpecious, and beautiful; but leaves it as full of ſtench, and rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as it was before. This is a Flower that grows in the Garden of Nature, and may ſpring up and flouriſh in that Heart, which is wholly barren as to any of the ſaving fruits of the Holy Spirit. There may be <hi>this fruit</hi> in the Life, when there is a <hi>root of bitterneſs</hi> in the Heart: ſuch an <note place="margin">Heb 12. 15.</note> one is like an embalmed Carcaſs, that is as really dead, as a putrified one tho' not ſo loathſome and offenſive to the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>This particular Righteouſneſs will not legitimate our hopes, not juſtifie our claim to Heaven. Many of theſe Righteous Men will be excluded the Kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove: tho' they ſhine as Stars in this World, they ſhall ſet in everlaſting dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the next.</p>
            <p>They ſerve at preſent like Salt, to keep the World from putrefying and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but at length like Salt which hath loſt its ſavour, they ſhall be caſt unto the Dunghil. Indeed this falls in with the character of a good man; but it doth not make up the whole of it. This Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that is at preſent under our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, is more extenſive and large, of a more Univerſal and comprehenſive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and that it muſt be ſo, appeareth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60842:17"/> by what it ſtands in a juſt, and direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to in this verſe [the Wicked:] this word doth not denote a Man guilty of one particular crime, or ſome ſinful act; but a man that is habitually and ſtatedly bad. Nothing more common and frequent in the Sacred Writings, than the oppoſition of righteous, and wicked, and both theſe terms, here, and in many other places muſt be taken in a large and comprehenſive; and not in a limited and reſtrained ſence. This Righteouſneſs which is but a ſingle, particular Vertue, is a part, and member of the new Creature, without which let men pretend what they will it is but a deformed Monſter. Good God! how doth Satan impoſe upon, and our own Hearts deceive us, when we can conceit our ſelves to be <hi>good Chriſtians,</hi> when we are not <hi>honeſt men!</hi> Tho' this be neceſſary, yet there muſt be ſomething more to conſtitute the nature, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the character of a Righteous Man; and this ſingle and ſolitary Vertue, is not ſufficient to qualifie any for ſo high a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, as this in the Text. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Righteouſneſs muſt be taken in a more large and extenſive ſenſe; comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of much more than hath been ſpoken of under the former head.</hi> Now there is a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60842:18"/> three-fold righteouſneſs, which we may take notice of, that we may find out what is eſſential to characterize the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon here ſpoken of.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>A Perſon may be denominated righteous, from an exact and entire conformity to the Law of Works.</hi> Righteouſneſs is a relative term, and doth ariſe from a conformity to that Law to which it hath a reſpect; and if it have relation, and be adaequate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correſpondent to the law of works, made for innocent man it is a legal righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. When a man is inwardly and outwardly, in the frame of his Heart and actions of his Life; in his deportment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and in his carriage towards men, ſuch as the Law requires, he is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: when every thought, motion, and paſſion, every glance of the Eye, every word of the mouth, and every ſtep he takes, is ſuch as the Law requires; when the Divine Law in every point and puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio of it, is written in the Heart and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without any blots, and blurs, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Life; when every precept is obey'd, and every commandment ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the whole latitude and extent of it; when obedience is entire without any defect; perfect without any flaw; Univerſal without breaking the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; Perſevering without any Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60842:18"/> when all duties, perſonal and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, publick and private, to God and Man, are performed; and no one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, tho' never ſo minute is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then is the man righteous: he is ſo in himſelf, in the Eye of the Law, and in the Account of God. This Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is nothing but a perfect and ſinleſs obedience. This was the righteouſneſs of Innocent <hi>Adam.</hi> This is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of confirmed Angels; thoſe elder Brethren of ours who have always been with our Father, and never offended him, they can <hi>lift up their faces without ſpot;</hi> tho' <note place="margin">Job. 11. 15.</note> to ſignifie how they are awed by, and reverence Divine Majeſty, they are ſaid to <hi>cover</hi> them <hi>with their Wings.</hi> This is <note place="margin">Iſa. 6. 2.</note> the righteouſneſs of our Redeemer; he is ſtiled emphatically <hi>the Holy one of God;</hi> and <hi>the Holy Child Jeſus;</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But this is not the righteouſneſs of any of <hi>Adam</hi>s wretched poſterity. Behold <hi>We are all of us as an unclean thing:</hi> our blood was ſtained in the firſt fountain of <note place="margin">Iſa. 64. 6.</note> it; and we derive (ſad thought!) guilt and pollution with the humane Nature. We are guilty before we are born, and ſinners as ſoon as we are men; <hi>for by the diſobedience of one Man many were made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom 5. 19</note> Now (deplorable ſtate!) <hi>the whole</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60842:19"/> 
               <hi>World is become guilty before God:</hi> the Law <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 19.</note> convinceth all of ſin; among all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Apoſtate <hi>Adam</hi> in this ſenſe, <hi>there is none righteous, no not one.</hi> Our original <note place="margin">Rom. 3 10.</note> ſin, were we guilty of no actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; one ſpark of Luſt glowing in our Hearts, did no ſmoak or flame break forth at our Mouths, renders us unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the account of the Law; nay hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once ſinned, it can never be poſſible to be denominated righteous by this Law, which condemns for one ſingle crime, as well as for a thouſand. Our whiteſt Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have ſome ſpots and ſtains; and the faireſt Chriſtian many blemiſhes and wrinkles; our beſt duties have many failings, as to principle, manner, and end; our pureſt gold much droſs, and our ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Graces many defects; having a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature within, every thing that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from us, like pure Water out of a muſty Cask, is tainted: our perſons, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and graces, want the blood of Chriſt to waſh; and the Mercy of God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them. If the holieſt man upon Earth (Lord what will become of the ungodly and the ſinner!) ſhould be tried by the Law, in the Court, and at the Bar of Rigorous Juſtice, he would be caſt as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous: He even he muſt ſay with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly David, <hi>Lord enter not into judgment with</hi>

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60842:19"/> II. <hi>A man is Righteous as intereſted in the perfect Righteouſneſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Chriſts Righteouſneſs was not only for himſelf, but for his members; though this be inherent in the Perſon of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, yet we have as much benefit by it, as if it were Subjectively in us. The Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Death of Chriſt were not for his own Sin but ours: <hi>He was made Sin</hi>

               <hi>for us, i. e.</hi> our Propitiatory Sacrifice, and <hi>We are made the righteouſneſs of God in him;</hi> we have the fruit of his bitter ſufferings and cruel death. He fulfilled the Law, ſatisfied Juſtice, and paid our Debt, and for his ſake God looks upon, and deals with believers as righteous perſons. As the diſobedience of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> makes us <hi>Sinners;</hi> ſo the perfect and ſinleſs obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt the ſecond, makes us <hi>Righteous:</hi> As our ſins were laid upon Chriſt, in order to his bearing the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo his righteouſneſs by a gracious and favourable act of God, our Supream Judge, is made ours, in order to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Our own righteouſneſs is both a filthy and ragged garment, through this God our final Judge, will ſpy the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and nakedneſs of our Souls; and Chriſt our Elder Brother (infinite grace!) covereth us with the unſpotted robe of his own. Chriſt took our ſins, and gives
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60842:20"/> us his righteouſneſs; bleſſed Exchange! From <hi>Adam,</hi> our natural Root and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we derive Guilt, Weakneſs and Death; from Chriſt our Spiritual Head, we have <hi>Righteouſneſs, Strength</hi> and Life; <note place="margin">Iſa. 45. 24.</note> and therefore he is ſtiled, THE LORD <note place="margin">Jer. 23. 6.</note> OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. This is the only Righteouſneſs we muſt make mention of, when judged according to the Law given to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency: A Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and believing Sinner, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth Chriſt Jeſus, the Lord, is for Chriſts ſake eſteemed, reckoned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, and dealt with as a righteous Perſon. Though this righteouſneſs be of a peculiar conſideration, and cannot be thought to be meant in all thoſe places, where this word <hi>righteous</hi> occurreth, yet it is abſolutely neceſſary; for Chriſt, and what he hath ſuffered, and done is the Spring, Cauſe, and Foundation of our hope. The immediate and doleful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of being <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> is to be <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note> 
               <hi>without hope in the World:</hi> This fruit grows no where but upon Chriſts Croſs; it is his Death that made Heaven poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a fallen and Apoſtate creature, and it is the ſprinkling of this Blood, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives our languiſhing, withering, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hopes Oh!

            <p n="3">III. <hi>A man is Righteous, and may be deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated ſo from that perſonal Evangelical righteouſneſs, that is inherent in himſelf.</hi> We muſt not only be intereſted in the Righteouſneſs of another without us; but have one that is really ſubjected in our ſelves: Or, which is all one, we muſt not only have Righteouſneſs imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but Holineſs imparted. Chriſt doth not only cover our running ſores, and ulcers; but undertakes as our Phyſitian to cure them. All Righteouſneſs, as hath been already hinted, conſiſts in a relation to ſome Law; and that we might truly State what this Evangelical Righteouſneſs is, that hath ſo great a Privilege entail'd upon it, as this in the Text; I hope none will be offended, if we diſtinguiſh (as we find the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth,) of <hi>the Law of Works, and the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 25.</note> 
               <hi>Law of Faith;</hi> the one framed to the State of an Innocent; the other adapted to the condition of an Apoſtate Creature. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this latter it is, that thoſe who have once been Sinners may be made, and denominated Righteous. <q>That part of the Goſpel revelation which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60842:21"/> contains and diſcovers our Duty, what we are to be and do in order to our Bleſſedneſs, being as to the matter of it, the whole Moral Law, before apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Covenant of Works, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered to the State of fallen Sinners, by Evangelical mitigations and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, by the Super-added Precepts of Repentance and Faith in a Mediator, with all the other duties reſpecting the Mediator as ſuch; and cloathed with a new form as it is now taken into the <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>How</hi>'s Bleſſedneſs of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, <hi>p.</hi> 26.</note> conſtitution of the Covenant of Grace is the rule of this righteouſneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He that ſolemnly repents of his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Apoſtacy from God, and all the ſins that have followed thereupon; he that is united to Chriſt by Faith, and yields ſincere, though imperfect obedience, from an active and living principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; he that is renewed and changed, turned from the love of ſin in his heart, and the practice of it in his Life; he that hath ſolemnly and deliberately, ſincerely and unfeignedly, covenanted with God, and dedicated himſelf to the Sacred, and Glorious Trinity; Father, Son, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and lives ſuitably to ſuch a devoted State; He that is born of God, bears his Image, lives in communion with, and walks in conformity to him, is righteous:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60842:21"/> Though his bloody iſſue may not be wholy dried up; though there be indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſin in the heart, and ſome ſins and falls in the Life, though no grace be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as to degree, yet if there be SIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CERITY and UPRIGHTNESS (Oh! look after that) he is a righteous man. The Law calls for perfection, but the Goſpel (Oh! thanks be to God, we are under ſuch a merciful, favourable. and gentle diſpenſation,) accepts ſincerity. This righteouſneſs is not meer morality, a being juſt and honeſt in our dealings; this is the righteouſneſs of an <hi>Heathen:</hi> It is not an external obſervation of the Letter of the Law; this is the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a <hi>Phariſee;</hi> and ours muſt <hi>exceed</hi> his, or we cannot <hi>Enter into the Kingdom</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 30.</note> 
               <hi>of Heaven.</hi> It is not a ſingle act, but a ſtated temper; it is not an obedience that Proceeds from rotten, but what flows from ſincere and gracious Principles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominates a man Righteous. A wicked man may do ſome acts of Devotion and Piety, Charity, and Juſtice, Sobriety and Temporence, but becauſe the ſetled bent and inclination of his will is another way, he is not righteous: And though a good man may be guilty of ſome Errors and miſcarriages in his Life; yet while this living Principle remains, and is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60842:22"/> we <hi>may,</hi> and if we will ſpeak in the Language of the Goſpel, we <hi>muſt</hi> call him a righteous Man. This Righteouſneſs is nothing but a tranſcript of the bleſſed Goſpel; a conformity in the inward, and outward man, in ſpirit, and practice to the Divine Revelation made by Jeſus Chriſt: A renewed and vital principle in the heart exerting its ſelf in ſuitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments to God, and man. In ſumm, Repentance from dead Works, and new Obedience, impregnated by Faith, and Love, are the two eſſentiating and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive parts of this Goſpel Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>For the eſtabliſhing of this notion, it is not neceſſary to inſiſt on any laborious Proof; when a great part of the Bible ſpeaks to this purpoſe: Hear once for all what the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>He that doth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Righteouſneſs is righteous.</hi> What can be the meaning, what can be the import, what ſence can with any tolerable ſhew of reaſon be aſſigned; but what ſuiteth with our preſent notion? <hi>He that doth Righteouſneſs i. e.</hi> He that perfectly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys, fulfils the whole Law <hi>is righteous:</hi> Is this the meaning? Then God help and pity us, where ſhall we find a righteous man? Is it, <hi>He that doth righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, he that being in a State of grace
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60842:22"/> lives up to the rules of the Goſpel; is guilty of nothing but what is conſiſtent with ſincerity; and is continually labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after perfection <hi>is righteos?</hi> Is this the import, and gennine ſenſe of this phraſe? Then thanks be to God ſome ſuch are to be found. And thus much for the firſt General, the Character of the perſon here ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>Secondly; <hi>We are to conſider what is here ſuppoſed and taken for granted, with reference to this righteous man; and that is, he muſt die.</hi> It may be you may think ſuch an one as I have deſcribed ſhould have a Protection; be privileged from that which is the common lot of others; be wafted over to Heaven, from one World to t'other and not ſee Death; be caught up to Paradiſe and not be put to the pain of dying: But it is ſuppoſed, and taken for granted in the Text, that the righteous man muſt die.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed our Lord Jeſus, the Captain of our Salvation hath perfum'd the grave; conquered death; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed him that had the power of it: He encountered this enemy, conquered, and triumphed over it, and every righteous man ſhares in that victory, and triumph. Chriſt hath deſtroyed the power, chang'd the nature, pluckt out the ſting of death;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60842:23"/> and diſarm'd it of its terrors; and the righteous may boldly challenge it, and with an exuberant joy triumph over it in the words of the Apoſtle: <hi>O Death, where</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 55.</note> 
               <hi>is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? The Sting of Death is Sin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law. But thanks be to God,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">v. 57.</note> 
               <hi>which giveth us the Victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus (O happy men!) may they triumph over death: But yet their righteouſneſs cannot, ſhall not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them from the ſtroke of it: No, no, Saints, and Sinners; Good, and Bad; the Holy, and Prophane; the Righteous, and the wicked are under the ſame uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable neceſſity of dying: Though they ſhall not be damned; yet they muſt die: Though they ſhall not be ſent to Hell; yet they muſt go to the Grave: Though they ſhall be ſaved from that hot, fiery furnace; yet not from the cold, dark, and ſilent Pit: Though their Souls ſhall not become a Prey to Devils; yet their Bodies muſt become a Banquet for Worms: Though the Soul ſhall not be rackt, and tortured in the diſmal Regions below; yet the fleſh muſt ſee Corruption: Though they have Manſions in Heaven; yet Sickneſs will ſhake; ſhake! Alas! Death will pull down the Walls, and tear up the very Foundations
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60842:23"/> of their <hi>Earthly Tabernacle:</hi> Though they ſhall go to Heaven; yet death will carry them thither in its cold Arms. Becauſe Chriſt who is their Head, and Husband <hi>Lives they ſhall Live alſo.</hi> Live! Where <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 19</note> ſhall they live? In <hi>Yonder</hi> glorious Heavens; in <hi>Yonder</hi> bleſſed abodes; in Manſions of light, far above <hi>Yonder</hi> ſhining Sun; there, there it is theſe righteous ones ſhall live: But alas!

Could all Graves be open'd, could we ſtand in ſome convenient place, and at one view behold the many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands Death hath captivated, and ſlain; could we ſee all the Carkaſſes that have dropt into, and are now rotting in duſt; we might ſay, Lo! all theſe were firſt the ſpoils of ſin; and then the Trophies and Triumphs of Death. This is the account Scripture gives of Deaths Univerſal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: Sin, curſed Sin, (oh what Fools are we to be fond of it! oh what infinite and unaccountable madneſs is it to lay, and hug that hiſſing Serpent in our Boſoms, which will ſting us to Death!) is the cauſe of all thoſe Funerals, which have been, are, or ſhall be in the World. Now, tho' the Righteous are renew'd, and ſanctified, they are ſo but in part: they have ſin in them, the meritorious, and deſerving Cauſe of Death; and therefore that Sentence, that carries Death in it; DUST thou art, and to <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 19.</note> DUST THOU SHALT RETURN muſt be executed even upon them. Tho' they are pardon'd, yet their Pardon runs
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60842:26"/> with an exception of Death: 'Tis true for Chriſt's ſake, upon the ſcore of that painful, ſhameful death he in their place, and ſtead underwent upon the Croſs; the SECOND Death, which is Death with an Emphaſis, ſhall have no power over them: but notwithſtanding all he hath done, and ſuffered, becauſe they are ſinners the FIRST muſt, and will. How far death to good men is a penal evil, and yet retains the nature of a puniſhment; I ſhall not in this wrangling age, offend any by attempting to determine. It may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that ſin brought death into the World, and furniſhed it with thoſe Weapons wherewith it wounds and kills all. If any ſay ſince the death of Chriſt, and the effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his blood upon the Croſs, Death is rather an advantage to his followers: I grant (and thanks be to God) it is ſo: but may not death be the Wages of ſin, tho' a good, and kind God makes it the path to Heaven? and this leads me</p>
            <p n="2">2. To conſider the death of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, <hi>as a Means of their deliverance from ſin; and the appointed way to the glorious Manſions which are above.</hi> 'Tis true, God could make us perfectly holy, take away the life, and deſtroy the very being of ſin, the firſt moment of our converſion: when
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60842:27"/> we have done his will, ſerved the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of his Grace, and attain'd the end of our being born; by an happy, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and eaſie tranſlation he could take us up, Body and Soul to Heaven: but he hath otherwiſe determin'd, and made Death neceſſary in order to both. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Divine Conſtitution they muſt firſt dye, and then be perfectly holy, and finally happy.</p>
            <p>Do you ask why the righteous die? why! that ſin might be deſtroyed, as Sin brought Death into the World; ſo Death ſhall (excellent contrivance of Infinite Wiſdom!) for ever aboliſh Sin: tho' death had its ſting, ſtrength, power, nay its very being from ſin; yet it proves by the ordination of God the deſtruction of it. Thoſe Arrows of Death which kill the Chriſtian, ſtrike thro' the very Heart of his Sins, and Luſts, and they both die together. A Saint puts off the Garments of Mortality, and his filthy Raiment at once: the ſin that was born with them, and lived with them, and accompany them from place to place; in their laſt moments takes leave of them for ever. The Chriſtian dies, that Sin may do ſo too. To this more will be ſaid here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

You have ſeen; ſeen! Oh how often have you ſeen that the Righteous die as well as the Wicked! that Death preys upon, and the Grave ſwallows up one as well as the other! Have you not many, and many a time viſited them, when ſickneſs had lodged them in their Chambers, and confin'd them to their Beds? Have you not heard their laſt ſobs, and groans, ſeen their dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pangs, and agonies? Have you not clos'd their Eyes, laid them in their Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60842:31"/> and often attended their Funeral; followed them to their long Home, and leſt them in duſt and darkneſs? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Righteous die; but how dieth the Righteous? as the Wicked? no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, as they do not live, ſo neither do they die as the Wicked. A righteous man may have the ſame diſeaſe; be exerciſed with the ſame pains; and feel the ſame pangs in a dying hour: But upon a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual account the difference is vaſtly wide, and great; he <hi>hath hope in his death.</hi> Before I diſtinctly conſider, what is the Object of this Hope; to prevent any miſtake, it is neceſſary to premiſe theſe two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Every righteous perſon, every man that falls within the already-mentioned Character;</hi> i. e. <hi>every ſincere and upright Chriſtian; hath ground of hope in his death.</hi> This does not only belong to ſome ſpecial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites; but is common to all who have God for their Father: The Promiſes, which are the foundation of a Chriſtian Hope; are not made only to Apoſtles, and eminent Saints, to men of renown in the Church; but they belong to, nay, are the Birth-right of even thoſe, who are but Babes in Chriſt. All that are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60842:31"/> born again, tho' all are not of the ſame growth, ſtature, and ſtrength, are <hi>Children;</hi>

               <hi>Grace;</hi> and all that bear this Character are allowed, encouraged, nay command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hope: Their hoping is as mighty a pleaſure to God; as it is a comfort to themſelves. Hath the bleſſed Jeſus poured out prayers, and tears, and blood; did he groan, and die on the Croſs, that they might have a Manſion above? Hath the Holy Spirit in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the ſame bleſſed deſign; been at the pains to renew, convert, and change them? Hath he reſtor'd them to the image, and likeneſs of God; that they might be capable of the enjoyment of him? Is he daily forming and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempering their ſpirits more, and more
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60842:32"/> for the heavenly ſtate, and employment? Hath God the Father, in his Eternal Counſels deſign'd Heaven for them? Hath he made them many expreſs, and plain Promiſes of it; and can he take it ill they live and die in hope? Lord! how infinitely unreaſonable are we; and how do we diſcourage the Death of the Son; the work of the Spirit, and the Promiſes of the Father; nay, not only naked Promiſes, but Promiſes repeated over, and over, ſeal'd, and confirm'd with an Oath, by encouraging our doubts and fears! all theſe may, and ought to hope.</p>
            <p>May I (ſays many a doubting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian) hope?

That holy Soul may paſs ſafely thro' the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their Enemies; that they might not be ſcared, terrified, or daunted by thoſe ſwarms of unclean ſpirits which lie up and down in the Air, a good God hath appointed a Convoy of Angels to attend them: and no doubt a convenient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them ſtand round about the Death-bed of every good man, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately receive his Soul when it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired. Some think that the fiery Chariot and Horſes in which <hi>Elijah</hi> mounted up to Heaven was a Convoy of Angels; however for this they have a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and thoſe good, and kind ſpirits do not diſdain to perform this laſt act

Lo this is the hope of the Righteous at death: Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Priviledge!</p>
            <p>Thirdly; <hi>The Righteous have hope of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from Hell, and the torments of the Damned.</hi> The afflictions of time are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the miſeries of Eternity: The diſtreſs, and anguiſh of a poor creature ſtretcht on the Wheel, rackt, and tortur'd in every limb, part, and member, is but a weak, and faint reſemblance of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and agonies of deſpairing Souls in Hell. The pains of the firſt, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the pangs of the ſecond and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death: There is a fire kindled that ſhall never go out; flames burning which ſhall never be quencht; a Worm to gnaw that ſhall never die; and Devils to torment, who ſhall never be weary of that bloody, and helliſh work: There impenitent ſinners (oh how terrible and dreadful a place is Hell!) muſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60842:46"/> feel the ſtrokes of Revenging Juſtice; the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>es of their own Enraged Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; drink of the Cup of the Wine of the Wrath of God; and be ſcared with the ſight of ten thouſand ugly Devils They muſt burn, and not be conſumed; be tortured, and never die; have pain, and no caſe; trouble, and no reſt; ſorrow, and no joy: tho' they go laughing to Hell, they ſhall never laugh more; they ſhall have an eternal night, and no day; be fill'd with deſpair, and have no hope. Hell! what an amazing word is it? Hell! how extreamly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy are the thoughts of it? Hell! whoſe heart does no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But a Righteous man (Lord! what muſt be the joy of his departing Soul!) hath hope in his death, he ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from all this. I muſt die (may he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60842:46"/> ſay) but I ſhall not be damn'd; I muſt go to a cold, dark, ſilent, and ſolitary Grave: my Glaſs is run, the number of my years, months, hours, and moments is now finiſht; I am going to my long home: but I ſhall not be ſent to an hot, burning, and flaming Hell. My fleſh, <hi>this</hi> Body of mine muſt ror in duſt; but my Soul ſhall not burn in that fiery Oven. the way which leads to thoſe Chambers of horrour, and darkneſs, is broad, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad; the Gate that leads to Hell is wide, and ſtandeth open day, and night, and thouſands go in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reat; but I hope I ſhall take another path. 'Tis true, I, ſinful I, have deſerved Hell again, and again, and I might have been in it long ago; but I do hope (thanks be to God) I do hope, and will hope my bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus will ſnatch me, as a firebrand out of thoſe everlaſting burnings; <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly; <hi>The Righteous at death hath hope of being immediately received into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and welcomed by all that are there.</hi> The Souls of Believers being ſeparated, do not wander up and down in <hi>yonder</hi> vaſt, large, and capacious Regions; much leſs are they (according to the Roman
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60842:47"/> Fable) to ſuffer in Purgatory, pains equal in degree to thoſe of Hell; tho' not ſo laſting; but they immediately go to Heaven. <hi>This day</hi> (ſays our Saviour, to the penitent Thief; the Companion <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 43.</note> of his Croſs) <hi>ſhalt thou be with me in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.</hi> And the reaſon of <hi>Paul</hi>'s earneſt, and vehement <hi>deſire to depart,</hi> was, <hi>that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23.</note> 
               <hi>he might be with Chriſt.</hi> The Gates of Heaven are open'd, they enter in, and they (happy Souls!) are welcomed by God, Chriſt, Angels, and all their Elder Brethren who died in the Lord, and went to Heaven before them. With what joy does God the Father receive thoſe Souls for whom he deſigned Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from all Eternity? With what joy does the bleſſed Jeſus welcome thoſe Souls to Glory, for whom, and whoſe Salvation he wept, and ſweat, bled and died! Oh what a joy is it to the heart of Jeſus, to ſee them paſt all the dangers and hazards of a troubleſom Voyage; and ſafely arriv'd at his Fathers houſe! With what a triumphant joy are they wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed by Angels, and the whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the ſpirits of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect! Oh how glad are all thoſe kind, and loving ſpirits, to ſee others come to Heaven, who ſhall be ſharers with them
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60842:47"/> in one and the ſame undivided happineſs, and parners with them in ſinging <hi>Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs</hi> to God, and to the Lamb! It is no ſmall joy to them that more Voices are added to the heavenly Quire.</p>
            <p>I (may the dying Chriſtian ſay) muſt leave Earth, the houſe in which I have lived ſo long; death is about to open a door for my immortal Spirit to go out at; and methinks I ſee my God, my Jeſus opening the Gate of Heaven: I hope when death has turn'd it out of this frail, and earthly Tabernacle, God and Chriſt will receive it into Everlaſting Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: I ſhall not want a Lodging, for God hath prepared, and Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a glorious Manſion for me. Go out, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> with holy joy, and triumph; haſten, be gone, for lo thy Throne is prepared, and yet ſtands empty. When I am dead, my ſurviving Friends will weep for me, with ſighs, and groans lament my departure; but God, Chriſt, Angels, and Saints will welcome my Soul to Heaven. Surely thoſe holy Spirits who rejoyced when I was converted, and born again; will ſing a new Song, a peculiar Pſalm of Praiſe to their God, and my God, when I am born into Eternity.

            <p>Fifthly; <hi>They hope to go to better Friends, better Company, and have that Viſion of God, and Chriſt, which cannot be had on this ſide the Grave.</hi> In this World good and bad, Saints and Sinners, the Righteous and the Wicked live together; and what a grief, and torment is the very preſence, and company of theſe Devils in fleſh to thoſe who really intend, and in good earneſt deſign Heaven!

                  </gap>ommunion of Saints:</hi> But the beſt here are imperfect; there is ſomething in the beſt, that their converſation is not ſo taking and ſuitable, ſo ſweet and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing, as we could with. How oft do they prove a ſcandal, and ſtumbling block
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60842:48"/> to us; or we an offence and grief to them! but at death they go to better; to ſuch as love them more, and wiſh bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to them than their deareſt Relations here can do: To <hi>Friends,</hi> who love each other as themſelves: To <hi>Friends,</hi> in whoſe Converſation there is nothing but what is peculiarly delightful, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, ſweet, and amiable, charming, and endearing, moſt highly grateful, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging: To <hi>Friends,</hi> who are utter and perfect ſtrangers to that four and peeviſh, moroſe and ſelfiſh temper, which prevails too much in this wretched, and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate World of ours: To <hi>Friends,</hi> who partake of, and ſhare in one anothers joys, and are as much pleas'd with the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others, as with their own: To <hi>Friends,</hi> whoſe tempers will be agreeable, whoſe looks will be pleaſant, whoſe hearts will be free and open; whoſe ſpeeches will be raviſhing, and all whoſe diſcourſes will be ſeraphick and ſublime; and yet ſet off with all the graceful Airs of a Charming Rhetorick.</p>
            <p>Further, while we dwell in fleſh, and ſojourn here below we ſee God but thro' a glaſs, and that very darkly too: To day we enjoy and are raviſht with ſome
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60842:49"/> views of him; and perhaps to morrow, nay, it may be before night the Curtain is drawn, or a cloud interpoſes and we cannot ſee him. But after death we (if we fall under the Character of the Text) ſhall ſee him Face to Face, by a light which is more clear, conſtant and laſting. Now we delight in, believe on, deſire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and love that bleſſed Jeſus, whom we have not yet ſeen: But after Death we ſhall <hi>ſee him as he is;</hi> and will not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very view of Jeſus be tranſporting; will <note place="margin">1 John 3. 2.</note> not every glance be the Spring of a new, and freſh joy! What is the language of Death to a Holy Soul but this? Come, ſee and enjoy that God whom thou haſt long waited for, and looked after: Come, and ſee that Jeſus, who out of a deep pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and compaſſion, wept, and groaned, bled, and died for thee: Come, take thy place in Heaven, where thou mayeſt glut, and ſatisfie th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:60842:49"/>
            <p> Is this the language of Death? Then what may be the language of the dying Chriſtian? Hearken, don't you hear him ſaying? The day is dawn'd, the time is come, the hour is now haſtning, that I muſt be gone; my Phyſitians neglecting any further preſcriptions, your paſſionate weeping, and ſilent tears, (O my ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friends?) The ſenſible decays I find in my ſelf; in thoſe parts which live the longeſt, and die the laſt, all tell me my end is near: Here, I have Relations who are Loving, Careful, and Tender; many Friends hath God raiſed up to me, and made them inſtrumental for my good, but I can willingly, chearfully, bid fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to all; for I hope to go to an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of better Friends, and more perfect Lovers: I have had thoſe ſights of God in the Sanctuary that have been ſweeter to me than all the pleaſures of this vain World; but I hope for a fuller view, and a more raviſhing ſight of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious being. Can't I ſee God and live? Oh let me die, for then I hope, I know I ſhall! I have heard of Chriſt; I have talkt of Chriſt, and (bleſſed be God) I have met with Chriſt in Prayer; Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and at a Sacrament.

A wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man can have no good hope either living or dying; and that falſe hope he maintains, and cheriſhes in health, when ſickneſs comes many times takes the wings of the morning and flies away.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60842:72"/> utmoſt endeavours that we may have hope, and not only ſo; but that our hope may be ſtrongeſt when Nature is weakeſt, and lively in our dying Agony; and that our beſt, richeſt, and ſweeteſt Wine may be reſerved to the Laſt!</p>
            <p>Hope! how can we live without it? Hope! what ſhift can we make to die without it? Hope! how inſipid are the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Life! Hope how uncomfortable are afflictions, how overwhelming are the terrors of Death without it! Hope! how does it lighten every Burden, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en every Cup, and make every Croſs the more eaſie Hope! what ſafety may we have from it in every conflict, as it is our <hi>Helmet;</hi> what ſecurity in every ſtorm <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 8. Heb. 6. 19.</note> as it is our <hi>Anchor!</hi> Hope! how does it raiſe our Spirits, warm our Affections, invigorate our Endeavours, encreaſe our Love, inflame our Zeal! Hope! how does it enable men to contemn, flight, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe all the admired and adored vanities of an empty, and periſhing World! Hope what a pleaſing reliſh does it give of every promiſe! What a ſprightful accent to all our praiſes; and what a captivating power to every thought, and proſpect of Heaven! Hope! how doth it make us
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60842:72"/> more moderate in our deſires, more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt in our requeſts, and more indifferent in our endeavours after theſe mean, and little things here below! Of what uſe, and benefit is this hope to us? A ſtrong and confirmed hope will be of great uſe; when a weak and wavering one will do us but little ſervice: And how careful ſhould you <hi>Righteous one's</hi> be to get, and keep, cheriſh, and maintain a good hope! How induſtriouſly ſhould you endeavour to live in Hope; and above all, to die in hope! That you may have this hope, and the comfort of it too, when your Sun is going down, and night is coming. You ſhould labour after this lively hope.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For God's ſake.</hi> The infinite doubts, fears, and jealouſies which many ſincere Chriſtians cheriſh; their drooping and deſponding complaints; their melancholy walking; and uncomfortable lives reflect on that God they ſerve as if he were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and diſgrace that beſt of Religions, which they have eſpous'd as if it were good for nothing but to make men dull, ſad, and mopiſh. Men ſee ſo little pleaſure in Religion, becauſe they ſee ſo little comfort in the lives of its Votaries: and if an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60842:73"/> Life do ſo much; will not an uncomfortable Death do much more? For ſuch men to be dejected, and caſt down in ſickneſs; to ſhiver, and tremble when death approaches; to queſtion their right, and title to Heaven when they are going to it, may very much diſhonour God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon Religion; and prejudice the Wicked: ſhould any of theſe men be in the Chamber of ſuch a dying Chriſtian, how would they at leaſt, ſecretly pity him for his eaſineſs, and credulity; deride Religion, and ſcorn an holy life! with what diſdain would they be ready to ſay? <hi>See what all his Religion is come to; what is the fruit of his praying and hearing; his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and circumſpect walking; Death is as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to him as it would be to us: he talkt of Heaven all his Life-long but now where is his hope? what is become of his confidence? When he had heated his brain and phanſie with ſome religious exerciſes; how pleaſantly could he talk of Heaven? But now Death is approaching what little ſupport has he from thoſe thoughts?</hi> Thus may your doubts, and fears ſtrengthen the hands, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the Hearts of the wicked: and tell me Chriſtian, is it not a trouble to thee to think, thou ſhouldeſt diſhonour God, and diſcredit Religion, and that Religion which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60842:73"/> ſhould be dearer to thee than thy Life; in the very laſt part, and concluding act of it? Can the thought of it be tolerable to thee? Therefore for God's ſake, and Religions ſake get HOPE: for if you be comfortable and joyful then, (and if your hope be lively you may, and will be ſo;) you may convince, however you will ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence Theſe <hi>fooliſh men,</hi> and perhaps after your deceaſe they may bethink themſelves, and ſay, <hi>ſurely Religion is no vain thing; there is more in it than we know of, for how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. <hi>For your own ſake.</hi> Is not death ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, and do you want nothing to arm and fortifie you againſt it? but what will or can, if you have no hope?

Will you want nothing to help you when you come to grapple with this huge <hi>Goliah,</hi> this mighty Conquerour, DEATH? verily you will; and what can ſuccour, ſupport, and help you in that hour but a lively hope? Would you not have your Hearts ſink, and die within you? Would you be able to receive the Sentence of Death in your ſelves with a quiet, and calm ſubmiſſion to God's Will? Would you die in peace, and go off with triumph? then get, and maintain a <hi>lively hope.</hi>

Oh! get this hope, that you your ſelves, and others too may know where death will Land you: why ſhould you be ambitious of going to Heaven <hi>incognito;</hi> and as it were by ſtealth? Why ſhould you not let all know, that that

            <p>Now, that you who are Righteous may have a lively hope in your Death; I ſhall lay down, and do you practiſe theſe following directions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Get, and maintain a firm, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led belief of a future happineſs.</hi> Content not your ſelves with the gueſſes, and conjectures of an Heathen; with a cold, and naked opinion that is eaſily ſhaken with the breath of the next Temptation; with a Faith, which is the fruit of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and Virtuous Education; and is only the conſequent of having been born, and brought up among a ſort of men called Chriſtians, an avowed Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of whoſe Creed is, <hi>the Life everlaſting:</hi> but let your Faith be built upon ſure Grounds, Divine Revelation; and let it be quickned, and rais'd to that degree that it may preſentiate the future glory to you; that it may ſtand as a Rock un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable in the midſt of Storms; and like a brazen Wall blunt, and beat back
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60842:75"/> all thoſe Arrows of Temptation, which are ſhot againſt it. Faith lays the Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and Foundation for hope: the Creed of a Sadducee and the hopes of a Chriſtian are not reconcileable; if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is no other World but this, how can I have hope of any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Grave? and if my Faith be weak and wavering a dead, and lifeleſs thing; will not my hope be ſo too? As the Lamp goes out unleſs there be Oil to feed it, ſo hope will wither, languiſh, and die except Faith maintain it. Hope ſprings from Faith, is nouriſhed by, and is in proportion to it. In order to a lively hope, it is neceſſary we conquer our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, and watch, ſtrive, and pray againſt an <hi>evil Heart of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> Hope <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 12.</note> will not, indeed none of the Fruits of the Holy Spirit can thrive, or flouriſh while this <hi>root of bitterneſs is in the Heart.</hi> Let us then uſe all the means appointed that we may be <hi>ſtrong in Faith,</hi> the life of our <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 20.</note> hopes, nay the life of all our Religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend's upon the certainty of a future ſtate: blot this Article out of our Creed, and you ſtab Religion to the Heart: the whole of Religion in a manner, depends on the truth of this one, ſingle Article; <hi>a life to come,</hi> and thanks be God we are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60842:76"/> not left without plain, abundant and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof of it: and they who are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidels in this age, and in this part of the World, they are ſo not out of neceſſity; but rather out of choice. Let us then with the greateſt ſeriouſneſs of Spirit, intention of mind apply our ſelves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the many, and clear evidences there are of a future ſtate; and tho' Satan may raiſe Batteries againſt our Faith; yet let us defend it, and pray to God it may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail. Let Faith often travel into <hi>yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> Eternal World: ſend it as a Spy to take a view of the Heavenly <hi>Canaan;</hi> and firmly believe the report it brings back: for our Faith muſt be ſtedfaſt, if ever we would have our hope unſhaken.</p>
            <p>Secondly; <hi>Walk cloſely with God, and take heed of all known, willful, and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Sins.</hi> Having ſolemnly dedicated your ſelves to the glory, and ſervice of the Bleſſed Trinity, Father, Son, and Spirit, walk according to that dedication: Watch againſt every thing that may give a wound to your ſincerity, or cauſe you to queſtion it. If you would have hope in your Death live according to your Character, <hi>Righteous perſons,</hi> What is the fruit of your ſloth and negligence;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60842:76"/> the conſequent of your hearkning to ſin, and complying with temptation, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing jealouſies, and tormenting ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, blotted evidences, and languiſhing hopes; want of aſſurance, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly joy that flows from thence? Am I in a ſtate of Grace, and do I belong to God? Will God reward ſuch poor, and mean performances with Heaven? Is not my hope vain, and only the counterfeit of that which is in true Chriſtians? Shall I ever be happy, or may I venture to hope I ſhall? Are the diſconſolate reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the careleſs Chriſtian upon the neglect of duty, and commiſſion of ſin: It is thus; and have not ſome of you found it ſo? Willful, and preſumptuous ſins will raiſe black, and dark clouds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and Heaven: Theſe clouds may eclipſe the light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance at preſent; and break, and fall down in terrible ſtorms, and tempeſts in the evening. What a dreadful change did holy <hi>David</hi> find in himſelf after his unhappy, and ſcandalous fall? How did it damp his joy, blot his evidences, and ſtab his hopes? Poor man! he is wrapt up in clouds, and darkneſs, and in great diſtreſs, and agonies of Soul cries to God; <hi>Lord! reſtore to me the joy of thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>

            <p>On the contrary, an holy obedient life; a ſtrict, and circumſpect walking with God will both warrant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our hope.

Our <hi>Hope</hi> as well as our <hi>Faith</hi> without works will be dead: But a ſtrong and lively; a certain and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hope will be the iſſue of an holy, and obedient life. It will entitle us to the promiſe, and warrant our hope of the reward. Would you then have hope in your Death? Mortifie ſin, ſubdue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and crucifie the old man; keep up the Government of Grace, and the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60842:77"/> Authority of Chriſt in your Souls; watch againſt ſnares and temptations; keep your garments undefiled and your ſelves unſpottep: Remember every will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſin wounds your hope.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; <hi>If through the ſtrength of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and violence of temptation you chance to miſcarry, and fall; endeavour to riſe again by a ſolemn, ſerious, and ſpeedy repentance</hi> We (thanks be to God) are not under the Law, which requires a ſinleſs, ſpotleſs obedience as the condition of Life: But under the Goſpel of the meek, and merciful Jeſus, which requires and admits of repentance: And whenever we have wounded our ſelves by ſin; it is our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and wiſdom to betake our ſelves to this remedy. Though you cannot keep your ſelves innocent, yet be ſure you do not live impenitent: If you do defile your garments in one inſtant, be ſure you waſh them with a flood of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential tears the next: Keep Conſcience wakeful, and tender that it may ſharply reprove you when you do amiſs; and when Conſcience looks upon you, as Chriſt did upon <hi>Peter</hi> do you alſo <hi>go out</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 75.</note> 
               <hi>and weep bitterly.</hi> Let your repentance be ſerious and ſolemn; with bluſhing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60842:78"/> and ſhame; confuſion and ſorrow; with hearty ſighs and groans; with a broken heart and contrite Spirit; with a bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul and melting affections: With all the ſigns of a Goſpel-repentance, and unfeigned remorſe, confeſs and bewail your late ſin, or ſins before God: Let your confeſſion be free, and not forc't; particular, and not general, and the more to affect, melt, and humble you, aggravate your ſin with the ſeveral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which did attend the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it: And then beg of God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don you. Plead, Chriſtian, plead as for thy life, that that ſin might not eclipſe the light of his countenance; deprive thee of the comforting, and witneſſing preſence of his Spirit; that it might not prove either the damnation of thy ſoul; or the deſtruction of thy hopes: And do all this ſpeedily while the wound is freſh and green; before it rankle and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie. While you delay your repentance your hearts will grow more hard; your conſcience more inſenſible; and the neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bruiſe which you got by your fall will grow worſe, and worſe; and if it be not timely lookt after may prove the death of all your hopes. After the heat and hurry of the day, does conſcience in the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60842:78"/> cool of the evening cite thee to make thy appearance in its Court? Summon thee by ſome ſudden rebuke, and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing terror to hold up thy guilty hands at its Tribunal? As ſoon as ever this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Judge reads the Bill of Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and brings the bloody charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee; betake thy ſelf to a ſerious repentance, revoke, retract, and wipe out thy ſins by an immediate act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. 'Tis true, 'tis infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>to be righteous perſons who need no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; i. e.</hi> to be guilty of as few ſinful <note place="margin">Luk. 15. 7.</note> miſcarriages! as we can: But in caſe we do fall we have this remedy at hand, and we muſt uſe it. If I ſin in the day, I ought to go and be reconciled to God, and my own Conſcience before night. If we take this courſe our hope which was withering, languiſhing, and dying, like graſs ſcorcht with the heat of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sun; being watered with theſe ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of penitential tears, may revive, ſprout forth, and flouriſh again; and be freſh in the very evening, This is the way to have great peace in Life and at Death.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Daily exerciſe Faith in Chriſt; eſpecially as Crucified, and Riſen from the Dead.</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:60842:79"/> Chriſt by his Blood-ſhed and Death; by his paſſion, and the Sacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the Croſs has bore the Curſe of the Law, ſatisfied Divine Juſtice, and quench'd thoſe Flames of Wrath we had kindled: he hath expiated our ſins, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the Devil, and diſarmed Death: he paid our Ranſom, Redeem'd us from Hell, which we can hardly think of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horrour, and trembling; and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Heaven, where we long and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be: he hath opened the Gates of Heaven, and invites and beckons us to enter in; and oh how powerful are the thoughts of a weeping, bleeding, groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and dying Jeſus to revive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the dying hopes of poor Sinners! Do I ſtand amaz'd at the thoughts of my guilt; overwhelm'd with the ſight of my ſins; terrified with apprehenſions of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Severity and Juſtice? Do I in the depths of a melancholy grief cry out, my hope is gone; woe is me! my hope is gone; can there be any hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, any Heaven for ſuch a wretch as I am? how can I, how dare I hope! oh that I could hope! but alaſs! the Law Curſes and Condemns me; and I (O miſerable man!) have little or no hope: I would think of <hi>Chriſt our Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi>

               <hi>Sacrificed for us.</hi> In this caſe what is to be done? Shall I ſink under the burden; abandon all hope; indulge my ſorrow and fear, and give way to a ſelf-tormenting deſpair? No, I would go to mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and ſet my ſelf at the foot of my Redeemers Croſs: I would often look up to a bleeding and dying Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; think what he ſuffered, for whom, and for what end; and then I would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this dying Jeſus in the Arms of my Faith: and after this how ſoon would hope begin to ſtir? Chriſt <hi>dying</hi> on the Croſs, and Chriſt <hi>living</hi> in the Heart is the foundation of our hope; and thanks be to God, 'tis ſuch a Foundation as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſhaken.</p>
            <p>I add further, it is infinitely uſeful to conſider, and act Faith in Chriſt as riſen from the Dead. Had our Lord Jeſus onely died, and not riſen again; had he been yet ſleeping in the Grave as Death's Eternal Priſoner; had he not after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time reviv'd, and roſe, and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 18.</note> and to Eye him as riſen is very ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to quicken our hope: how fully, even beyond all poſſibility of doubting,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60842:80"/> does the Reſurrection of Chriſt aſſure us that his Death was valid; his Sacrifice accepted, our debt paid, and juſtice ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: that he did all that was neceſſary to expiate our ſins; and finiſhed the work of our Redemption before he gave up the Ghoſt and Died on the Croſs! with his laſt, with his dying Breath he cried out, <hi>It is finiſhed;</hi> and is not his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection <note place="margin">Joh. 19. 30.</note> a full, convincing, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable evidence of the truth of that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did Juſtice releaſe, and Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er bring him out of Priſon? Did God give him an open, and publick acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? And is there any ground to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the payment of what we ow'd, and he undertook to ſatisfie for? may we not from hence conclude to our unſpeakable comfort, incouragement, and joy the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his Death; the validity of his ſufferings; and the perfection of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice?</p>
            <p>Moreover, does not the Reſurrection of Chriſt diſcover the poſſibility of ours? nay is it not the cauſe, and reaſon, the earneſt, and pledge of it? Did he roll away the Stone from his own Sepulchre; and can he want power to roll it away from the Graves of his People? Is the

               <hi>ſprung up at night,</hi> and <hi>withered the next Morning.</hi> A ſound hope is the fruit of many Prayers and Tears; much watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and holy walking; and we have reaſon to ſuſpect that hope we come ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily and quickly by. Such an hope may a little comfort us in the Sun-ſhine of the Day; but not when the dark Night of Death is coming.</p>
            <p>If you would have your hope to be lively at Death, examine carefully the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60842:82"/> grounds, and reaſons of it; what footing there is for thy hope in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. That hope, and no other which hath been often brought to the Touch-Stone, and tried is like to laſt when grim, and frightful Death ſhall look us in the Face. Ask your own Conſciences a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that hope that is in you, and take not up with the firſt anſwer; but let this weighty and momentous queſtion be oft repeated, and as often anſwered; and by this means you will be leſs apt to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it hereafter: it will then be ſtrong, and lively when Nature is weak, and feeble; and afford you joy, and raviſhment when the Shadows of Death ſhall ſit on your Eye-lids; and your Immortal Spirits are taking Wing, and flying to the other World. An hope that is taken up no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy knows how, or why will certainly fail, when there is moſt need of it.</p>
            <p>Retire then (Chriſtian) from the World, and ſet ſome hours apart for this great Work, and ſpeak to thy ſelf in ſome ſuch manner as this: Death, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> is coming, and after that men go to Heaven, or to Hell; in which of theſe muſt I be, and dwell for ever? whither muſt I go when I die? where
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60842:82"/> will death land me? Shall I go to God, or Devils? Be reeeived up into a Manſion of light above; or be caſt down to a Dungeon of Darkneſs below? When I ſhall knock at the Gate of Heaven, and ſay Lord, Lord open to me; am I like to be admitted, or deny'd? When thou O my Soul! ſhalt leave this Body, ſhalt thou under the conduct of Holy Angels, go to the joyful aſſembly above; or be drag'd by Infernal Spirits, who lie watching for their Prey, to the Congregations of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils beneath? Thou art going, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> thou art going to an ETERNAL World: but is it to an happy, or a miſerable one? to ETERNAL Joys, or to ETERNAL Sorrows? to Heaven, where is an ETERNAL Day; or to Hell, where will be an ETERNAL Night? It is well with me at preſent, I am full, and at eaſe, I want nothing this World can afford; <hi>The lines are fallen to me in a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 6.</note> 
               <hi>place; I have a goodly Heritage:</hi> but how is it like to go with me hereafter? Will it be well, or ill with me for ever? <hi>O my Soul!</hi> ought I not, ſhall I not be concern'd to know how it will fare with me for ever.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:60842:83"/>
            <p> Hope of Heaven is very common; who almoſt among the ſons of men does not hope for it? But how many are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken now; and diſappointed hereafter! How many have lived in hope, and dyed in hope, and after all been for ever ſhut out! Oh how many have been impoſed upon by Satan, cheated, and deceived by their own hearts; and am not I in danger of being ſo too? Is not Satan as cunning and ſubtil now as he was then? Is not my heart as baſe, falſe, deceitful, and treacherous as theirs; and am not I as likely to be blinded by ſelf-love as they were? How much hope is vain, falſe, and groundleſs, ſerving only to delude men at preſent, and ſhame them for ever! How many have been buoyed up, and fluſht with hope on a Death-bed; and in a little time (Doleful moment) ſwallowed up of total, final, and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs deſpair! What if this ſhould be my caſe? What if it ſhould be ſo with me?</p>
            <p>Do I hope for Heaven? <hi>O my Soul!</hi> of what kind is my hope? What was the Spring? What is the Nature? What are the Effects? What Stamp is it of?
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60842:83"/> Whoſe Superſcription does it bear? Is it any better; is it any thing more than <hi>the hope of the Hypocrite which ſhall periſh?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job 8. 13.</note> Will it endure a trial at the Bar of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and at the Bar of God too? Have I any one promiſe in all the book of God to countenance my hope; and warrant my expectation? This queſtion is weighty, and important, and to miſtake here may be very fatal, and is infinitely dangerous: Therefore tell me <hi>O my Soul!</hi> what manner of hope is thine? Thus, and thus I find it is with them who have a good hope; Is it ſo with me or no? I am loth to be deceived, afraid of being miſtaken, therefore <hi>O my Soul!</hi> deal plainly, and truly with me. <hi>O my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence!</hi> take the candle of the Lord, and ſearch me, and faithfully tell me (as thou wilt anſwer the neglect another day) whether my hope be ſound, and good or no.</p>
            <p>If you would take this courſe what a confirmed hope might you have in Life, and what a lively hope in Death? An hope that would mitigate the terrors, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the horror, aſſwage the pangs, and ſweeten the agonies of a dying hour. With ſuch a hope you may die not only
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60842:84"/> ſafely, but comfortably too: go to your Graves not only in peace but with triumph. While other mens Chambers are filled with diſconſolate ſighs, and groans, yours may ring with acclamations of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſongs of praiſe: While the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakned, and deſpairing ſinner is crying out; muſt I die! muſt I die! <hi>O my weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friends!</hi> muſt I die! your looks may be pleaſant, your countenances chearful, and your hearts tranſported with joy: You may be able to welcome Death, and triumph over the Grave; you may have ſuch a glorious proſpect of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs above, that you may praiſe God with your laſt, with your dying breath; and Hallelujah may be your <hi>laſt</hi> word in this World as well as your <hi>firſt</hi> in the next.</p>
            <p>Infer. IX. <hi>Hence we may learn how to carry it with reference to thoſe Righteous, and Holy Relations of ours who had ſuch hope in their Death.</hi> Are any of our holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations dead; and did they die in hope; and is there no duty incumbent on us who are left behind? Have we nothing to do, but to provide for their funeral, and follow them to the grave? Alas! as to them when we have done this we
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60842:84"/> have done all we can for them. When we have got them a Coffin, purchaſed a Grave for, and laid them in it, we can do no more for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But at ſuch a time is there nothing to be done by us for our ſelves? Does not the Death of an Husband, a Wife, a Father, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther call upon ſurviving Relations to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it? At ſuch a time God calls, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence calls, and Death calls upon us to mind our duty. I ſhall not largely treat on this Head, but only ſhew what is to be done by us, with reference to them as they died in HOPE.</p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>We ſhould take notice of, and remark their happy, and comfortable end.</hi> We ſhould obſerve, regiſter, and remember Gods kindneſs, and love to; his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and merciful dealings with them in their laſt ſickneſs, and on a Death-bed. It cannot but be uſeful to take notice of the miſerable end of many wicked men. Is Conſcience awakned, and all their ſins ſet in order before them? Are they filled with horror, and anguiſh? Is ſome of the everlaſting fire flaſht in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Does the Devil begin <hi>to torment them before the time?</hi> Is God a terror to <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 29.</note> them and they a terror to themſelves?

               <hi>praiſe God; but the living, the living they ſhould.</hi> When they were ſick you did (I am ſure you ſhould) pray for them; and being dead, and having died in hope you ſhould give thanks to the Father of Mercies for his Mercy to them; for his goodneſs to them in the cloſe, in the evening, in the concluding act of their lives. Tho' (thanks be to God) we know nothing of praying for the Dead; yet we may, and ought to praiſe God for his Grace to them; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for that Grace which enabled them
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60842:88"/> to go off, and die ſo well. Did God in the evening viſit their Souls, ſpeak peace to their Conſciences, publiſh their Pardon, and carry them beyond the fear of Death, and the Grave? Did the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter come, and did they find, and feel he was; before death did? did God open the <hi>Eyes</hi> of the Soul to read their Evidences for Heaven, before death cloſed <hi>thoſe</hi> of the Body? did God ſhine in upon their Souls, <hi>and in the evening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time was it light?</hi> did you hear them ſpeak <note place="margin">Zech 14. 7.</note> of their departure without Tears, and Groans; nay, with Joy, and Triumph? did you ſee a Calm upon their Spirits? did you ſee them compoſe themſelves to die in the ſame manner they were wont to do when they went to ſleep; with little, or no difference, only an <hi>unuſual coldneſs?</hi> and did they thus die? Lord what praiſe is due to Free Grace! Is it not the duty, and intereſt of the Husband to bleſs God for his mercy to his departed Wife? Is it not the duty of Children to offer up a Sacrifice of praiſe to their God, and their Fathers God, for the ſeaſonable help, the gracious ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and the ſuitable comforts afforded to a Father, to a Mother in a dying hour? ſhould not as many praiſes be given to God
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60842:88"/> for his mercy to their Souls as Tears ſhed over their Coffins, and Graves? what praiſes! oh what hearty praiſes are due to God; that they ſet ſail with a fair Wind, an happy Tide, and got ſafe to Shore! is it not melancholy, and ſad to ſee ſuch near Relations full of doubts, and fears crying out, I cannot die; I dare not die; and did God prevent all this by giving them hope and the joy of hope too, before they left us to go to him? and ſhould not God have the Glory that is due unto his name? Our ſacrifices of praiſe ſhould mount up to Heaven in a pure, and bright flame, and there meet the Souls of our deceaſed Relatives Thankſgiving and Praiſe is a debt which holy perſons, who were thus priviledg'd in their laſt moments; would have their ſurviving Relations pay to God in their name, and ſtead.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another Duty, <hi>is a careful imitation of their holy Lives.</hi> This is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial branch of that Communion we have with departed Saints: and the nearer they were to us in the fleſh, the more careful we ſhould be to imitate them.

            <p>Were they humble and meek; quiet and patient; holy and heavenly? were they devoted to God, and to the ſervice of the Redeemer, and did they live, walk, and act as ſuch? did they ſlight the World, and all the gay and charming vanities of it; and fill up every Relation with duty? were they given to ſecret Prayer, did they keep up Communion with God, adorn their holy profeſſion, and live ſuitably to it at all times? did they carefully husband, and redeem their Time, wiſely imploy, and improve all their Talents? were they kind, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, liberal and charitable; and did they <hi>live as Heirs of the Grac of God;</hi> and Candidates for Immortality; and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectants <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 7.</note>

Was God (ſhould ſuch an one ſay) my Fathers God, and my Mothers God, and ſhall I forſake or caſt him off? Oh what a ſin, and ſhame is this! have I ſuch a fair Copy to write after, and will it not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflect on me if mine be full of blots and blurs? When you are tempted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you are the off-ſpring of them who were the friends, and lovers of God: that you are come of an holy ſtock; and then ſay, would my holy Father, my godly Mother who are now with God

Are they acting the part of holy Angels in Heaven; and ſhall I, the Son, the Daughter of ſuch Religious Parents be acting the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil upon Earth?

            <p>When an holy Father, or Mother dies methinks this is the farewell language: I have reſigned, and devoted my ſelf to God, and by his grace I have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled in ſome meaſure to live ſuitably to ſuch a ſtate. 'Tis true I have had my imperfections, and failings, many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities have attended me which I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewail, and unfeignedly lament; but I have (thanks be to God) I have the teſtimony of my Conſcience, I have been ſincere, and upright; and now at laſt God is beginning to give me the rewards of a holy Life. I have had in <hi>this</hi> ſickneſs much from God, and I hope for more: I am full, I am full of joy; I long, I long to be gone; would God my work
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60842:91"/> were done and I were gone: Religion is not a vain thing, and now I find it is not; I have ſerv'd a good Maſter, I have been his, I have lived as his and now upon a Death-bed he treats me as his own, as a Friend; as a Servant, nay even as a Child: I do not repent of my Prayers, and Tears, my Watching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and Wreſtling with ſin, my Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect walking, and my Holy Life, of any of the pains I took, the endeavours I uſed to be truly Religious. Repent! no, no, I do not, I thank God for h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s grace beſtowed on me, and that his grace was not altogether in vain. Tho' I relie only on the merits of Chriſt, and deſire to be found and accepted in him; yet I do, and can rejoice that my works prove my Faith to be more than a dead one: My fears are gone, my doubts are anſwered, my peace is ſetled, my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is quiet, my joy full, and I can die; and now by theſe my laſt comforts, by theſe my dying hopes, I beſeech, beg of, charge and conjure you <hi>O my dear Children!</hi> Whom I ſhall leave in a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed World to Serve, Pleaſe, and Honour God. What Errata's there have been in my Life let them be corrected, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in yours: And wherein grace
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60842:91"/> hath enabled me to be a follower of Chriſt, do you be followers of me; I now leave you to go to the Father; but this do, and God be with you, Amen.</p>
            <p>When Holy Relations are ſnatcht away, dead, and gone what doth more nearly concern them who are left than to ſtudy and imitate their Holy Lives; to tread in their ſteps, follow their example, and write after their Copy? Oh what a laudable ambition is it, to ſtrive who ſhall come neareſt to the Original, and whoſe Copy ſhall be faireſt!</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another duty incumbent on us, <hi>Is to be more ſpeedy, ſerious and ſolemn in making preparation for our own departure.</hi> Thoughts of Death ſhould be ſerious, lively, and affecting, and it is our ſin, and folly if any of them be cold, flat, dull, and ineffectual. Death carries that awful ſound, it is of that infinite concern, and importance that every view, thought, and glance ſhould be improved by us. We ſhould neither think, nor ſpeak of this ſolemn, and weighty thing, <hi>Death,</hi> without concern. But alas! while we only entertain our ſelves with meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tontem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ation,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60842:92"/> and naked ſpeculation, how little do the beſt of us advance in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al piety! How ſeldom is it that theſe thoughts make any deep, through, and laſting impreſſions upon our hearts! per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they ſcare and terrifie us at preſent, and produce ſome ſhort-lived pangs of a gaſping devotion; but how few are the better for walking among graves, and Tombs!</p>
            <p>By reaſon of a croud of worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſecular affairs, preſent proſperity and flattering hopes of its continuance; through vain ſports, and fooliſh paſtimes; carnal mirth, and ſenſual joy; the craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty inſinuations of a ſubtil Devil, and the fly ſuggeſtions of a deceitful heart moſt of theſe thoughts come ſhort of that end they are proper to attain. How few alas! how few in this dying World of ours, which every day, and hour is changing its inhabitants, are reform'd, amended, and made better! don't they love the World, purſue vanity, follow their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, neglect duty, forget God, and themſelves; have they not as ſtrong an appetite after the little things of time, and are not their affections to the great
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60842:92"/> things of Eternity as cold, and flat as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?</p>
            <p>But if it be ſo when we think of Death; ſhould it be ſo after we have ſeen it, and God has been holding the frightful picture of it before our Eyes? If this won't affect, and awaken (the Lord pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty us) what will? When a near and dear Relation is gone, the living ſhould prepare to follow: And if ſuch an one died in hope, it ſhould add Life and Vigour to our endeavours; for in them we ſee that to be prepared is no impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing. After ſuch a Providence it is ſeaſonable, adviſeable, and may be very profitable, and uſeful to make this enſuing Reflection.</p>
            <p>I am but poor Duſt, a crawling Worm, breathing Clay, a ſinful Creature; I muſt certainly, and I may quickly die: After a few more moments, and hours I may; after a few more weeks, and years I muſt. Ere long alas! in a little, little time it will be with me as it now is with this near, and dear Relation of mine. My breath will fail, my pulſe be low, my tongue faulter, my countenance change, my viſage will be marr'd, my
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60842:93"/> looks will be frightful and my body cold, and ſtiff: It is his, or her turn to die now, ere long it will be mine. May not I be the next perſon that falls ſick; the next time this grave is opened may it not be to receive me? The next Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral out of this Family, may it not be mine? The next Arrow that is ſhot may it not glance by others, ſtrike me, and leave me dead on the ſpot? Do I think of living many years, that it will be a long time before my preſent Leaſe be expired? Vain thought! do I talk of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther year, or day? This may be my laſt, and for ought I know it will be ſo: And is it not, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> my grand duty, my great concern, and ought it not to be my chief care to make my peace with God, to obtain the pardon of my ſin, and an intereſt in Chriſt, to get grace wrought, and the evidence of it that I may <hi>Die in Hope?</hi> That on a Death-Bed I may firmly depend on the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God; in my ſorrowful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments truſt in the Merits of Chriſt; and with my laſt breath commit my Soul to the care of my Redeemer; with Faith, and Confidence, ſaying, as ſome of the laſt words I ſhall ever ſpeak in

               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Another duty <hi>is to moderate ſorrow for the death of ſuch holy Relations, and Friends who died in Hope.</hi> Mourning for the dead is neither uncomely, nor unlawful: Nature commands, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion allows us to pay this Tribute at the Grave of deceaſed Relatives. Religion only corrects, it does not root out natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affections: it is only a Pruning Knife to cut off the luxuriant Branches; not an Axe to cut down this Tree at the Root. Religion is a Bridle to curb, and reſtrain; but not an Opiate to ſtupifie. We are not required to ceaſe to be Men when we become Chriſtians; Grace and good Nature are not ſuch Enemies that they cannot dwell together; nay, uſually the former thrives and flouriſhes beſt where there is moſt of the latter.

               <p>What is true concerning all, and every one of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity; Lord! help me to apply to my ſelf in particular: to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, conſider, weigh, and work upon my Heart this common truth; <hi>I muſt die.</hi> Let me not only have ſome general, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and ſpeculative knowledge; but a particular, ſerious, warm, and practical one; a knowledge that may be uſeful, and ſerviceable to the beſt purpoſes; a knowledge that may awe my Conſcience, warm my Soul, and powerfully influence my Heart and Life. It is impoſſible to be ignorant of this: but Lord! how cold, unactive, dull, and ineffectual were all thoughts of this kind when I was well, and ſtrong! oh that they may make more powerful, and abiding impreſſions upon my Heart, now I am ſick, and weak!</p>
               <p>Theſe very pains I now feel; this diſeaſe, this preſent affliction which makes me ſigh, and groan; this ſickneſs which I ſuppoſe will be my <hi>laſt</hi> tell me, <hi>I muſt die;</hi> and call upon me to prepare for ſuch a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60842:103"/> time that now cannot be far off. Lord, help me in this my great, and laſt work! oh that ſenſe and feeling might help my Faith! this fire warm my Heart; and what I now feel, prepare me for my laſt pains, pangs, and conflicts, which are like to be much ſharper! I have viſited others, ſome of them my near and dear Relations in their ſickneſs; I have ſeen them ſick, weak, and full of pain, I have ſeen their cold ſweats, their mortal tremblings, and heard their laſt and dying groans; and now it's my turn to be ſick, and my time to die. Die! how hard, and difficult a work is this! of what great concern, and everlaſting importance! Die! who does, or can know what it imports but thoſe who are dead, and gone? I thought it hard to ſee my Friend, my Father, my Mother dye; but ſhall I not find it more difficult now I am to dye my ſelf? the Meſſenger of Death has laid hold on me; I believe this ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will be my <hi>laſt;</hi> I have no hope of recovery: I have been ſick, and God hath recover'd me; at the Mouth of the Grave, and God hath brought me back; I have gone from my Sick-bed and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to my Shop and Trade; but now I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe I ſhall do ſo no more: my Sun is ſetting; my Glaſs is run, there are but a few remaining Sands; the Grave
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60842:103"/> with open mouth is waiting for me, and in a little time I ſhall drop into it. Moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lord, aſſiſt me now, and leave me not; through thy Grace I have lived; help me, Lord, help me now to dye as a Chriſtian: in theſe hours, and moments prepare me more and better for my laſt.

               </p>
               <p>Preparation for Death, Judgment, and an Eternal World (thanks be to God) I have not neglected: I did not in health adjourn this work to a time of ſickneſs; in order to this I have made many a Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſhed many a Tear, abſtain'd from ſin, and crucified the Fleſh: I ſpent much of my time in trying my ſelf, ſearching my Heart, and examining my State; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting of, and amending what I found amiſs: I was convinc'd a few death-bed Tears, and languiſhing Prayers extorted by fears of Death, and Hell would not make amends; or be a ſufficient compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for the ſins of a wicked Life, and therefore through the Grace of God aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, I made it the buſineſs of my Life to prepare to dye. But ſomething more is to be done, that I may glorify God in my Death; and be for ever happy after it: what remains, and is now to be done in this my laſt ſickneſs, inſtruct me Lord!
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60842:104"/> and help me to do it. I now ſtand at the Mouth of the Grave, upon the Threſhold of Time, and at the Door of Eternity; Lord! increaſe, ſtrengthen, and quicken all thoſe Graces which are proper to be acted in a time of ſickneſs, and on a death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. Oh! that now I am a ſick; oh! that now I am a dying man, my Faith, Love, and Hope; my Repentance, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and Sorrow; my deſires, and breathings after God; my joy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him may be more lively and active than ever? oh that this laſt work of my Life may be done beſt! my ſick bed joys may be the greateſt; and my dying com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts moſt abundant! through theſe pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hours, and days; this dark, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, gloomy, and frightful paſſage guide, direct, and lead me <hi>Lord!</hi>

Fooliſh talk! cannot God who provided for 'em by, take care of them without me? And if they are his, will he not? Cannot God who is the Fountain, be better than I, who am but a Ciſtern, and a broken Ciſtern too? May I not leave my ſolitary Widow, and Fatherleſs children with God?</p>
               <p>Am I loth to die <hi>now,</hi> becauſe I muſt take my final leave of Friends, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, whom I have lov'd, with whom I have liv'd, and converſed with much delight? <hi>Fooliſh Soul!</hi> loth to leave them! what, to go to God, Chriſt, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny infinitely better, to enjoy which, for one hour, is much better, than to enjoy theirs for an age.</p>
               <p>Am I unwilling to die <hi>now,</hi> becauſe of thoſe pains, and pangs, thoſe ſharp con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts and agonies I muſt endure, before body and Soul do part? Fond reaſoning! muſt not theſe pains be endured at one
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60842:123"/> time or other? will not Death be Death, that is, be attended with ſome pains whenever it comes? Had I not better take heart, and undergo them once, and that <hi>now,</hi> than be terrified many years longer with the fears and melancholy proſpect of them? Will not theſe pains be my laſt; and when they are over (and in a few hours they will) ſhall not I be at perfect eaſe and reſt? Hath God done, and the bleſſed Jeſus ſuffered ſo much for me? Is Heaven ſo bleſſed and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a place, that it tranſcends all I can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> imagin? And ſhall I make excuſes, and frame Apologies, reſiſt, and ſtruggle, be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and unwilling to endure a little pain that I might go to God, and Chriſt, and be in Heaven? Have not many endured more and greater pain, in hope of leſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage? Have I not a Saviour, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally knows what it is to be pain'd, and die, to ſtand by, ſuccour, ſupport, and aſſiſt me in this terrible paſſage from Time to Eternity? Finally, <hi>O my trembling Soul!</hi> may not the pains of that hour be much leſs, than I fear, think, and apprehend they will be?</p>
               <p>Am I loth to die <hi>now,</hi> becauſe <hi>this</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy muſt go to the grave, rot, and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and lie a long time among Worms? Fond affections to a lump of Clay! is this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60842:123"/> the reaſon of my unwillingneſs? <hi>O wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſinful Soul!</hi> where's thy Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that fundamental Article, <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
